DAppNode is a resilient and truly decentralized network that puts the power back into the hands of the people. It creates and maintains the infrastructure for anyone to run their own node, share information and validate an Ethereum Network. DAppNode is putting an end to the node oligarchy and safeguarding the free, decentralized world of the future.
### **`GET STARTED`**

*Network Numbers component*
DAppNode Network Today

1. Nodes [Real time count?]
2. Chains supported [10]
3. Average Eth2 staking returns
4. Token Holders [350]
5. IPFS hashs on the network?
6. DAO stats? - number of DAO members/Active Proposals etc..
7. Network Transactions/Network Validations

(Do you want to talk about the DAppNode Network or DAppNode on all networks?)

## Pioneering the next-generation of decentralization.
### DN (DAppNode) Token Holders are supporting a new ecosystem for decentralization.
 - Engage in DAO governance promoting a dynamic and holistic community.
 - Access and send transactions on the DAppNode Network
 - Participate in liquidity mining and airdrop incentives.
 - Run your hardware and stake DN on Validators to earn PoS rewards


Shape the future together with us

## The DAppNode Network 
### Foster the steadfast and uncensorable future of blockchain. 
 - Challenge the Node Autocracy; allow nodes to be ran by anyone, anywhere.
 - DAppNode Network is open, permissionless and EVM-compatible
 - The backbone for pushing decentralization on other blockchains.


Discover the possibilities

## Node Runners
### Setup your own node. Sustain a network and flip the script on node centralization.
 - Run nodes for any blockchain with a couple of clicks.
 - Low maintenance: decentralized auto-updates and alerts packaged out-of-the-box.
 - YOU host the data to keep information uncensored and accessible.
 - Stake in and validate PoS blockchains and earn on your crypto with minimal hassle and without intermediaries.
 - Connect to blockchains and DApps without intermediaries. Take control of your data and establish your digital sovereignty.


Run a node on almost anything; a server, an old computer, even a Raspberry Pi. The DAppNode FOSS Platform and plug-and-play boxes are easy to install and configure!
 ### **`SHOW ME HOW`**

## DAppNodeDAO
### The Cross-chain Governance Model for Inclusive and Efficient Decision Making.
The DAO will allow token holders on both Ethereum and DAppNode Network to participate in governance. DAppNode has tapped the Gnosis Safe SafeSnap Protocol as the DAO model, this will allow for on-chain actions to be voted on off-chain, via snapshot, avoiding network traffic and saving gas fees.

### A Token of Gratitude. 
Early DAppNode supporters have already been airdropped some DAppNode(DN) Tokens. Check here(ADD LINK) to see if you have any. Liquidity mining will also be introduced to encourage early token adoption.

### Get Connected. 
Join our community. The DAO is a critical component to keep the Network resilient and adaptable. We need free-thinking members to sustain healthy innovation and ensure DAppNode continues to be a hub of a decentralized universe.

## The Guardians of Ethereum
### ValidatorDAO Stands Watch. Protecting Ethereum 2.0 from Falling into Centralized Powers.
Ethereum 2.0 threatens to get caught in the same issue facing many PoS networks. Power coalescing at the top, compromising the future of a new decentralized financial engine.
### **`READ OUR MANIFESTO`**


This is the first feature project of DAppNode. ValidatorDAO will connect pools of stakers to pools of self-custodial validators ensuring network security doesn't collect into the hands of the few. Staker and Validator Incentives will be regulated by all DAO members. Governance will be open to stakers, validators and network architects. 

 
The DAO allows for validators to become trustless, and can move in and out of the validation pool without interrupting the network. Lowering the risk for validators allows more participation thus making the network as a whole more resilient. 

"The Guardians of Ethereum" is a collection of DAO members who will take the responsiblity of co-signing every action with validators and ensure appropriate distribution of validation keys. The Guardians will serve the greater community by surveilling the network to prevent or mitigate malicious actions to and from validators.
